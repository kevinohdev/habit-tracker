## Tech Stack
### Next.js 13, MongoDB, Prisma, Typescript


I wanted to build a full stack application using Next.js 13 and learn to use the routing and client and server side rendering provided by the framework.  

MongoDB is used for the database, and Prisma for queries. NextAuth.js is used to handle authentication.
